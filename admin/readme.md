## Chapter 3: Implementation

This chapter details the implementation phase of the Cairo University Platform, outlining the methodologies, user stories, product backlog, project estimations, and a comprehensive test plan.

### 3.1 Agile Methodology

The project adopted an Agile methodology, specifically incorporating principles of iterative development and estimation based on user stories. [cite_start]This approach allowed for flexibility and continuous adaptation throughout the development lifecycle, as evidenced by the "Iteration Planning"  [cite_start]and "Story Size Estimation"  frameworks utilized. [cite_start]The project embraced incremental delivery, with a planned total of 7 iterations, each aiming to deliver 25 story sizes, demonstrating a commitment to regular progress assessment and adjustment.

### 3.2 User Stories

### 3.5 Project Estimation

[cite_start]Project estimation was performed using the Story Point Estimation Model (SPEM). [cite_start]This model combines three parameters to calculate the "Story Size": Story Points (SP), Implementation Level Factor (ILF), and Complexity (Com).

**Story Point (SP):**
[cite_start]Story Points are relative measures of effort for a user story, categorized by size and weighted using the Fibonacci sequence.

| Parameter | Description | Weight |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------- |
| Very small story | [cite_start]1  | |
| Small story | [cite_start]2  | |
| Medium story | [cite_start]3  | |
| Large story | [cite_start]5  | |
| Very large story | [cite_start]8  | |

**Implementation Level Factor (ILF):**
[cite_start]ILF considers the level of understanding and experience with the components involved in a user story.

| Parameter | Description | Weight |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------- |
| Off the shelf | [cite_start]1  | |
| Full experienced components | [cite_start]2  | |
| Partial experienced components | [cite_start]3  | |
| New components | [cite_start]4  | |

**Complexity (Com):**
[cite_start]Complexity has been determined based on the user stories in ILF.

| Parameter | Description | Weight |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------- |
| Very low | [cite_start]1  | |
| Low | [cite_start]2  | |
| Medium | [cite_start]3  | |
| Large | [cite_start]4  | |
| Very large | [cite_start]5  | |

**Story Size Calculation:**
[cite_start]The Story Size is calculated using the formula: `Story Points * Implementation Level Factor * Complexity`.

[cite_start]Here's the detailed story size estimation for each backlog item:

| ID | Story | SP | ILF | Com | Story Size |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| ID_1 | As a user, I want to be able to register for an account on the Faculty platform so that I can access its features. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]3  |
| ID_2 | As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account so that I can manage my Profile and preferences. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]3  |
| ID_3 | As a user, I want to be able to search for available Tracks based on my location (Online-offline) and Registration dates. | [cite_start]5  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]10  |
| ID_4 | As a user, I want to be able to view details about each available Track, including its Topics, features, and price. | [cite_start]8  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]32  |
| ID_5 | As a user, I want to be able to select a Track and register it for my desired dates. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]6  |
| ID_6 | As a user, I want to be able to view my upcoming and past Registration. | [cite_start]5  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]10  |
| ID_7 | As a user, I want to be able to modify or edit my Profile if it is necessary. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]6  |
| ID_8 | As a user, I want to be able to securely enter my payment information to complete a Registration. | [cite_start]8  | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]24  |
| ID_9 | As a user, I want to receive a confirmation of my booking once payment is processed successfully. | [cite_start]5  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]20  |
| ID_10 | As an admin, I want to be able to add, remove, or update Track listings on the platform. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]6  |

| ID_12 | As an admin, I want to be able to add new Tracks to my inventory on the platform so that they are available for take. | [cite_start]5  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]10  |
| ID_13 | As an admin, I want to provide detailed information about each Track I list, including Topics, features and cost options. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]3  |
| ID_14 | As an admin, I want to be able to update information about my listed Tracks, such as availability and pricing, to reflect changes in my inventory. | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]3  |
| **Total Story Size** | | | | | [cite_start]**156**  |

**Iteration Planning:**
The initial velocity for this application was set at 25 story sizes. [cite_start]Based on the total story size of 156, the project required 7 iterations to deliver all planned functionalities.

| Iteration Number | [cite_start]1  | [cite_start]2  | [cite_start]3  | [cite_start]4  | [cite_start]5  | [cite_start]6  | [cite_start]7  |
| :--------------------------- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Story Size | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]25  | [cite_start]6  |

### 3.6 Test Plan

The test plan for the Cairo University Platform aimed to ensure the system's functionality, performance, security, and usability through a combination of white box and black box testing, with a focus on traceability and leveraging log analysis for problem identification and resolution.

**Test Objectives:**
* [cite_start]Verify that all functional  [cite_start]and non-functional requirements  are met.
* [cite_start]Ensure the system is secure against common vulnerabilities.
* [cite_start]Confirm optimal performance under various load conditions.
* [cite_start]Validate the user interface for intuitiveness and responsiveness.

**Test Scope:**
[cite_start]The testing covered all modules: User Authentication & Authorization, Student Application Management, Document Management, Payment Processing, Enrollment & Student ID Generation, Course and GPA Management, Certificate Request and Fulfillment, Support Ticketing System, Content Management, Reporting and Analytics, AI Assistant Integration, and Public Access.

**Types of Testing:**

1.  **White Box Testing (Structural Testing):**
    This focused on the internal structure and logic of the code.
    * **Unit Testing:** Individual functions and methods were tested in isolation. For example:
        * `User.set_password()` and `User.check_password()` in `app/models.py` or `models.py` (depending on the actual location) would be tested to ensure correct hashing and password verification.
        * `file_management.py` (if existed) or relevant S3 upload logic within `run.py`  would be tested to confirm files are uploaded correctly to AWS S3.
        * Logic for generating unique student IDs based on year, nationality, and program code within `run.py`  would be thoroughly tested.
        * GPA calculation logic would be tested with various grade combinations to ensure accuracy.
    * **Integration Testing:** Different modules were tested together to ensure seamless interaction. For example, the interaction between `Application` submission  and `Document` upload , and subsequent `Notification` creation  would be tested.
    * **Code Coverage:** Tools would be used to measure the percentage of code executed by tests, aiming for high coverage to minimize untested paths.

2.  **Black Box Testing (Functional Testing):**
    This focused on the system's external behavior and functionality from an end-user perspective, without knowledge of the internal code. Test cases were derived directly from user stories and functional requirements.
    * **Functional Testing:**
        * **User Registration & Login:**
            * Verify successful registration with unique email, email verification, and redirection to login page.
            * Test login with valid/invalid credentials, and unverified accounts.
            * Test password reset functionality via email link.
        * **Student Application Submission:**
            * Verify multi-step application form navigation (program selection, document upload, review).
            * Confirm dynamic loading of programs based on degree type.
            * Test document upload (PDF, JPG, PNG, max 10MB) and validation.
            * Verify application status updates and notifications.
        * **Admin Application Management:**
            * Verify viewing, filtering, approving, and rejecting applications.
            * Test sending notes to students, confirming ticket creation.
            * Test AI Assistant for transcript analysis by uploading a PDF and verifying analysis results.
        * **Payment Processing:**
            * Verify fee calculation based on nationality.
            * Test application and certificate payment flows, ensuring status updates.
        * **Support Ticketing System:**
            * Verify ticket creation by students with subject, category, priority, and message.
            * Test viewing and replying to tickets by students and admins.
            * Verify ticket status updates (Open, In Progress, Closed).
    * **UI/UX Testing:** Ensured the interface was intuitive , responsive across devices , and localized for Arabic (RTL support).
    * **Performance Testing:**
        * Measured page load times (aiming for <3 seconds).
        * Assessed database query execution times (aiming for <500ms).
        * Evaluated file upload/download efficiency to/from S3 (uploads <5 seconds for <10MB files).
        * Monitored AI analysis response times (aiming for <30 seconds for standard PDFs).

**Test Environment:**
* [cite_start]**Development:** SQLite3 database [cite: 77][cite_start], Flask's built-in server (implied by Flask framework usage ).
* [cite_start]**Production:** PostgreSQL database [cite: 78, 85][cite_start], Gunicorn with Nginx/Vercel for web serving [cite: 76, 80][cite_start], AWS S3 for file storage [cite: 86][cite_start], Mailtrap for emails [cite: 88][cite_start], Google Gemini API for AI.

**Traceability of Test Cases (Example):**

| Functional Requirement | Test Case ID | Description |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| [cite_start]FR1.1: User registration  | TC-REG-001 | Verify new user can register and receive verification email. |
| [cite_start]FR2.3: Document upload  | TC-DOC-UPLOAD-001 | Verify students can upload documents of allowed types and sizes. |
| [cite_start]FR5.2: Generate Student ID  | TC-ADMIN-ID-001 | Confirm unique student ID is generated and assigned. |
| [cite_start]FR8.6: Admin reply to tickets  | TC-ADMIN-TKT-001 | Verify admin can reply to a ticket, and status updates. |
| [cite_start]FR11.1: AI Transcript Analysis  | TC-AI-TRANSCRIPT-001 | Verify AI analysis button triggers analysis and displays results. |

**Solution Based on Logs (White and Black Box Testing Insights):**

Analysis of `logs_result (20).json` revealed key issues and insights into system behavior:

1.  **Missing CSRF Token Error (Critical Bug):**
    * **Log Entry:** `"2025-06-25 18:37:26,884 - flask_wtf.csrf - INFO - The CSRF token is missing."` resulting in a `HTTP 400` for `POST /admin/tickets/update_status/1`.
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** This indicates a severe security vulnerability where `Flask-WTF`'s Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism failed for an admin action. It means malicious requests could potentially be forged if not addressed.
    * **Solution:**
        * **White Box Solution (Code Fix):** Ensure that every form submission (especially POST requests) includes the `csrf_token` in the form data or headers. The `templates/admin/tickets.html` and `admin/routes.py` (or relevant admin routing file) should be checked to ensure the `csrf_token` is properly rendered in forms and validated on the backend. Specifically, the JavaScript logic sending the `POST` request for updating ticket status must include the CSRF token.
        * **Black Box Verification:** After deploying the fix, a black box test would involve manually changing a ticket status in the admin panel and monitoring network requests to confirm the CSRF token is correctly sent and the action is successful, without the 400 error.

2.  **404 Not Found Errors (Minor Configuration/Deployment Issues):**
    * **Log Entry Examples:**
        * `"GET /dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -`
        * `"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -`
    * **Impact:** These indicate that certain static assets or the favicon are not found at the requested paths. While not critical functional errors, they can affect user experience (e.g., broken icons, missing browser tab icon) and indicate deployment issues (e.g., incorrect path mapping in Vercel or missing files in the static folder).
    * **Solution:**
        * **Code/Configuration Check:** Verify the `url_for()` calls for these assets in templates (e.g., `templates/base.html` for Bootstrap JS, favicon link in HTML head). Ensure the files exist in the `static` directory or are correctly configured in `vercel.json` for Vercel deployments. The `vercel.json` routes `/(.*)` to `api/index.py`, meaning static files might need explicit handling or serving via a different mechanism if not directly routed.
        * **Deployment Review:** Confirm that the `dist/js` folder (if used for Bootstrap) and `favicon.ico` are correctly included in the deployment package.

3.  **Performance Insights (Monitoring Focus):**
    * **Log Entries:** Various `GET` requests (e.g., `/admin/tickets`, `/`) show `durationMs` values ranging from 5ms to 370ms. Some `durationMs` are `-1`, indicating logging limitations for certain requests (e.g., in `middleware` or very early in the request lifecycle).
    * **Impact:** While many durations are acceptable for typical web operations, continuous monitoring is necessary. `-1` durations highlight areas where more detailed performance logging could be beneficial.
    * **Solution:**
        * **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement dedicated application performance monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) beyond basic serverless logs to capture more granular timings and identify bottlenecks.
        * **Optimization:** Investigate functions with consistently higher `durationMs` (e.g., 370ms for `/admin/dashboard`) to optimize database queries (e.g., using `joinedload` or `selectinload` for eager loading relationships in SQLAlchemy, as seen in `app/models.py` or `models.py` database models) or computationally intensive logic.

This comprehensive test plan, coupled with continuous monitoring and log analysis, is essential for maintaining the quality, reliability, and security of the Cairo University Platform.
